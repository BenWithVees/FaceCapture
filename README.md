This is just a quick demonstration using OpenImaj

Here you will find:
  * Find detectected faces and create a bouding box around them
  * Detect and locate facial key features (corner of eyes, mouth and nose) on detected faces
  * Translate facial key points location to display correctly on an image
  * Create a shape for the key features on the face (It doesn't come with a getBounds() like faces do)
  * Crop the faces out of the picture and display each face seperatly
